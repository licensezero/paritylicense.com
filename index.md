title: The Parity Public License
description: the free for open source license
---

Parity is a public `LICENSE` for software that requires users who build with your software to share their work with the community, too.

In other words, Parity makes your work free for open source, like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com), and other services.

The latest version is [{{ site.versions.last.number }}]({{ site.versions.last.url }}).

[Old versions](/versions/) and [diffs](/diffs/) are available, as well.

Development continues in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/licensezero/parity-public-license).
