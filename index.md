title: The Parity Public License
description: the free for open source license

Parity is a public `LICENSE` for software that requires users who build with your software to share their work with the community, too.

In other words, Parity makes your work free for open source, like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com), and other services.

The latest version is [{{ site.versions.last.number }}]({{ site.versions.last.url }}).

You can find a [list of old versions here](/versions/).

For feedback and proposals, visit [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/licensezero/parity-public-license).
