Parity is a public `LICENSE` for software that requires users who build with your software to share their work with the community, too.  In other words, Parity makes your work free for open source, like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com), and other services.

On this site, you can:

- [Read the latest version of Parity](/versions/6.0.0.html) for yourself.

- [Peruse a showcase](/projects) of Parity-licensed projects.

- Review [old versions](/versions) of the license and [diffs](/diffs) between them.

License development continues in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/licensezero/parity-public-license).  Feel free to open issues and send pull requests.
